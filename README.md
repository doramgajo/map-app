Map is an Android map app that shows the place where I grew up.
It has markers at important places on the map and the possibility to add new markers.

The project was built using Kotlin, Android Studio and Google Maps API as part of a learning exercise.

> [!NOTE]  
This app was developed during my time as a student, under a tight deadline and while managing other projects. It offers the core functionality, but you may encounter bugs, rough edges, and code thatâ€™s not production-ready.
